## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Situation

 Horiseon already had a smooth-looking digital marking webpage but it was lacking quality accessibility standards. 

 The page needed a codebase that followed web accessibility standards so that the site was optimized for search engines.

 My aim was was to take a look at the existing code, increase the overall accessability for the webpage, and improve the code by introducing sustainable elements and styling. 




## :question: What Problem does this solve?

 Accessibility for Horiseon's webpage was a priority. They wanted their online presence to accommodate different accesibility requirements which would not only improve their brand reputation but also assist in mitigating the risk of litigation by being inaccessible.  

 By increasing the use of semantic code, the page becomes more readable for search engines & screen readers.  




## :seedling: What have I Improved in the Code?

 :pencil2: html has been ordered sequentially, with heading attributes falling in sequential order from H1 to H3 in both the html and style sheet. CSS selectors and proporties have been consolodated to follow the structure of the html.


 :pencil2: ARIA has been incorporated to increase accessibility for screen readers and  help assistive technologies better understand the layout of the page.


 :pencil2: Incorporated sections into the code to create landmark regions and then gave each region a semantically meaningful role to boost SEO. 


 :pencil2: Introduced identifiable areas of content by using visual allignment, spacing and inentations so the code is easier understood. 


 :pencil2: Added alt captions to all images and icons for accessibility should they fail to load.

 :pencil2: Added a touch of responsive web design so that the page is now responsive to screen size, futher increasing accessibility. 


 ## Outome

 Horiseon Digital Marketing now have a semi-responsive, accessible web page with smooth scrolling for the user, alt captions if the images/icons fail to load, and whole new sematic codebase with comments for each section. <br>
 
  The codebase now increases not only accessibility for screenreaders but has optimized content for search engines to drive even more traffic to the site.
